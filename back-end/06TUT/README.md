Best Practices in Nodejs

1 – Use HTTP Methods & API Routes => Done

2 - Use HTTP Status Codes Correctly => Done

3 - Use HTTP headers to Send Metadata => Done 

4- Pick the right framework for your Node.js REST API => Done "Express"

5 - Black-Box Test your Node.js REST APIs => TODO

6 -  Do JWT-Based, Stateless Authentication => needs revision

7 - Use Conditional Requests => needs more understanding and revision

8 - Embrace Rate Limiting => TODO

9 - Create a Proper API Documentation => TODO

10 - Don’t Miss The Future of APIs => needs learning
